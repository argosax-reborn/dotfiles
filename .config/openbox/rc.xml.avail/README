rc.xml.avail/README

Each file in this directory is a valid Openbox rc.xml configuration file.
The desired configuration can be selected by symlinking it to
~/.config/openbox/rc.xml.  If Openbox is already running, its configuration
must then be refreshed by running 'openbox --reconfigure' or by invoking
the "Reconfigure" Openbox action.
